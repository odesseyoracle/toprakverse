# ToprakVerse - Social Media Website

## Introduction

Welcome to the React Web Development project for the DCI Berlin Web Development course that we worked on from January 22 to January 30, 2024. 

## Project Overview

This project is a React-based web application that utilizes various technologies and libraries for creating a simple social media platform. Users can navigate through different pages, such as Home, Login, Friends, UserProfile, SignUp, and FriendPage. The application also features routing using react-router, state management using useUserContext from the UserContext, and the integration of third-party libraries like Google Fonts and Font Awesome.
